Overview of the project

Objective

Create a Python program to help track and manage student grades. The program will enable users to input grades for various subjects or assignments, compute average grades, and provide an overall grade summary along with additional insights.

Key Features:

User Input:

Allow users to input grades for multiple subjects or assignments.
Support flexible input formats (e.g., individual grades or batches).
Grade Calculation:

Calculate the average grade across all inputs.
Determine the overall performance, such as letter grades (A, B, C, etc.) or descriptive ratings (Excellent, Good, Needs Improvement).
Data Summary:

Display the calculated average grade.
Highlight the highest and lowest grades for additional insights.
Include a count of subjects or assignments entered.
Error Handling:

Handle invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., non-numeric grades).
Alert the user to unrealistic grades (e.g., grades outside the 0-100 range).
Optional Extensions:

Allow storing and retrieving grade data from a file.
Include trend analysis or suggestions for improvement based on average performance.

Implementation Steps:

Prompt the user to enter grades for subjects/assignments using loops.
Validate inputs to ensure they are numeric and within a specified range.
Calculate the average grade using the collected data.
Implement logic to determine the overall grade or performance descriptor.
Display a summary of grades, including highest, lowest, and average scores.
Optionally, extend functionality to save and load grades from files for future use.

Expected Outcome:
A user-friendly Python program for tracking and managing student grades. It will simplify the process of calculating average grades and understanding overall performance, making it a practical tool for teachers, students, or parents. The program can also be extended for more advanced features like trend analysis and data storage.
